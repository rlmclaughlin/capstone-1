<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
    I am researching various ecommerce sites and understanding what makes them successful. I am creating an ecommerce site that will be displaying inventory items and allowing customers to add them to a 'cart'. Once inside the cart, i will need to modify the inventory quantity, as well as, keep a running price total. This is a site that is for both customers as well as staff. If time permits, I will need to have a path for the admin. The two main features of this site is the modification of the inventory as well as the ability to purchase an item.

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>

I will research sites like Amazon, Ebay, and Etsy to understand what makes them successful. I want to understand any patterns in their UI and use the information to my advantage. Once I have spent time studying these sites, I will formulate a design for my site. I intend to draw it out, based off aspects that I like from the sites listed above. 

To begin, I will run through and add my html first, as well as connect the various components. I will also set up my files and have a main folder for my components. I will also have a main folder for my styles. 

I plan to lightly style as I go along, to prevent heavy additional work later. On day one and two, I will be more inclined to experiment with the presentation, but I intend to make a full comittment by wednesday. 

I will measure the complexity of my objectives on a chart and try to make a timeline that will gauge how long each task will take. From there, I can develop a logical path forward that will tell me if i'm on track. 

I want to have all my styling and primary functionality for the main features finished by thursday/friday. Over the weekend, I want to add additional features such as stripe, netlify, and an admin path. 

If main features are not complete by friday, I must structure a new logical path forward, based on the objectives that remain. The primary goal is to complete all of the main goals as early as possible.

    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
    I have added all of my dependencies first and followed up with HTML boilerplate. So far, everything is going according to plan and I have a wonderful pace. I'm going to start adding styling next and develop a full vision for the sites scheme.

    The sites pattern is fully understood and i'm in the beginning process of adding javascript to my components. Etsy has proven to be the template that I wish to be inspired from. I'm employing a minimalist approach to the site, while providing plenty of data for the user. 

    I've decided to have a recommendations page. I feel like the site needs as much content as possible to keep it interesting, yet I'm trying to avoid making it too 'busy'. 

    The shopping cart is proving to be slightly problematic due to random bugs. I've had to test it aggressively to ensure that it's up to par for the presentation. Each time that I feel like its decent, I'll discover another bug. I intend to continue testing it as much as possible to avoid any issues. 

    My pace has been terrific and I made a new path forward that will determine how much time I need to dedicate to each objective in order to finish on time. So far, my schedule going forward is looking realistic. I fully intend to have stripe added to this project. 

    My site is fully styled, my cart is functioning perfectly, and all of the requirements have been met. I now intend to add my admin path and I want to add stripe. I don't believe stripe will take long, so I intend to invest most of my time on the admin path. It will have a view that allows the admin to delete albums. 

    Added Stripe and cleaned up loose code today. Very happy with the end result and overall, things went really smooth. I'm satisfied with my overall execution and my schedule proved to be a powerful tool. 


<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>

I sincerely enjoyed working on this project and feel that it was a valuable tool for my learning experience. This forced me to dig deep to understand certain features. I learned a lot along the way and pushed myself in ways that I didn't know were possible. 

I've gone back and cleaned up most of spaces, console logs, and other assorted 'crumbs' on my files. I feel that it's now presentable and easy for anyone to read and/or understand. 

If I had more time, i'd go back and refactor some of the names I used for CSS. I initially didn't think i'd be recycling certain CSS classes in the way that I did. I found that I was able to recycle a lot of code, however, this means that the classes could have been more broadly labeled. If I didn't fear causing a last second problem, this is where i'd invest my energy. 

I'm happy with my javascript code. I did have a function that featured a loop with a nested loop. This is obviously not desireable for Big O reasons, so i'd love to be able to refactor that code too. I think if I had enough time, I couuld figure out a better solution for this section. 

Adding stripe was really enjoyable and i'm very excited by how user friendly it is. I intend to use it on personal projects in the future. Overall, this ecommerce site was great practice for personal projects that I have in mind. 

I'm very happy with my performance and had a wonderful time working on this site. While it's not perfect, it's an exciting acheivement when considering the time that was available. I moved much faster than I ever have before on a project, and in the process, I proved that I'm capable of building projects within a week. I don't have any regrets and intend to continue practicing the content I learned in this section.
